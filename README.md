## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The Stock Price Predictor project aims to develop a predictive model for stock prices using historical data obtained from Yahoo Finance. The prediction algorithm employed is the Support Vector Regressor (SVR), a machine learning technique known for its effectiveness in regression tasks.

### 1.2 Objectives
Developed a reliable stock price prediction model.
Utilized historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Implemented and fine-tuned a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) algorithm.
Evaluated the model's performance and accuracy.

## 2. Project Overview
The project focuses on predicting stock prices for a specific set of stocks based on historical data. It does not encompass real-time trading or financial decision-making.

## 3. Data Collection

### 3.1 Data Source
The project uses historical stock data obtained from Yahoo Finance. This includes features such as open price, close price, high price, low price, and trading volume.

### 3.2 Data Collection Method
Describe how the data is collected, whether it's through an API, web scraping, or other means.

## 4. Data Preprocessing
### 4.1 Cleaning
Handle missing values.
Identify and address outliers.
Check for data consistency and correctness.
### 4.2 Feature Engineering
Extract relevant features for prediction.
Normalize or scale numerical features.
### 4.3 Data Splitting
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## 5. Model Development : Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Explain the SVR algorithm.
Parameter Tuning: Describe the process of selecting optimal hyperparameters.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key findings, challenges, and lessons learned during the project.
