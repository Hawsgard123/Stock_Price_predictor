Project Documentation: Stock Price Predictor
1. Introduction
1.1 Background
The Stock Price Predictor project aims to develop a predictive model for stock prices using historical data obtained from Yahoo Finance. The prediction algorithm employed is the Support Vector Regressor (SVR), a machine learning technique known for its effectiveness in regression tasks.

1.2 Objectives
Develop a reliable stock price prediction model.
Utilize historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Implement and fine-tune a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) algorithm.
Evaluate the model's performance and accuracy.
2. Project Overview
2.1 Scope
The project focuses on predicting stock prices for a specific set of stocks based on historical data. It does not encompass real-time trading or financial decision-making.

2.2 Features
Data Collection: Utilize Yahoo Finance API or web scraping to gather historical stock data.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and other anomalies.
Model Development: Implement the Support Vector Regressor for stock price prediction.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using relevant metrics.
Deployment: Optionally, deploy the model for real-time predictions.
3. Data Collection
3.1 Data Source
The project uses historical stock data obtained from Yahoo Finance. This includes features such as open price, close price, high price, low price, and trading volume.

3.2 Data Collection Method
Describe how the data is collected, whether it's through an API, web scraping, or other means.

4. Data Preprocessing
4.1 Cleaning
Handle missing values.
Identify and address outliers.
Check for data consistency and correctness.
4.2 Feature Engineering
Extract relevant features for prediction.
Normalize or scale numerical features.
4.3 Data Splitting
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

5. Model Development
5.1 Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Explain the SVR algorithm.
Parameter Tuning: Describe the process of selecting optimal hyperparameters.
5.2 Training
Train the SVR model on the training dataset.

6. Model Evaluation
6.1 Metrics
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

6.2 Results
Present the performance results of the SVR model on the testing dataset.

7. Deployment (Optional)
If applicable, describe the steps for deploying the model for real-time predictions.

8. Conclusion
Summarize the key findings, challenges, and lessons learned during the project.

9. Future Enhancements
Discuss potential improvements or additional features that could enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
